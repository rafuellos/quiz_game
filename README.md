Exercise for Ironhack Bootcamp 

This is about as simple as it sounds, a command line game in Node that asks the user questions, and allows the user to answer.

First Iteration
Quiz the user with the questions, and if they provide the correct answer allow them to move on to the next question. If the user incorrectly answers, notify the user and repeat the same question again.

Second Iteration

Add points. If the user answers a question correctly, add to total. Keep track of the total points accumulated throughout the quiz, and display it to the user while asking the question. If a user incorrectly answers the question, make sure to subtract points before repeating.

Third Iteration

Bonus Question Randomly assign a question to be a bonus question for each quiz. Make this random question worth double the points.

Fourth Iteration

Letâ€™s create a User class now. Keep it simple, the only attributes our user should have are a name, their current points total, and the current question number they are on. Hard Code the user into the application, for now.
